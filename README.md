# Welcome to the classic snake game! 
This C++ program allows you to play the game using the command prompt. The game board is represented as a grid, and the snake is initially placed in the center of the grid.

## To control the snake, use the following keys:

'a': Move left
'd': Move right
'w': Move up
's': Move down
'p': PAUSE

If the snake eats the fruit (represented by an 'F'), it will grow and your score will increase also speed of snake increases. 
The game will also end if the snake collides with the grid boundaries or itself.

#### To exit the game, press the 'x' key. 
The program will then display your final score and an ASCII representation of the game grid.

###### Happy gaming!
